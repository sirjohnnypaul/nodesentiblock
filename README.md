The software is meant to make sentimental analysis of provided words, word pairs or sentences. 
Basically the software uses AFINN words that were ranked byt this organisation. The words database was also extended by custom ranked sets of words. 
The software allows also to add new words or wordpairs and rank them by the user. Then the analysis is being made while using all ranked words or word pairs resources.
I add the credit link below. Check the AFINN works.

To run the software simply clone or download folder. Perform NPM INSTALL and then NODE INDEX.JS - CHECK IT OUT, IT'S INTERESTING!
